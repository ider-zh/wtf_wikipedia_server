In the 19th century, Harvard was influenced by [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment Age]] ideas, including reason and free will, which were widespread among [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational]] ministers and which placed these ministers and their congregations at odds with more traditionalist, [[Reformed Christianity|Calvinist]] pastors and clergies.<ref name=Dorrien>{{Cite book|last=Dorrien|first=Gary J.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L50mveyi6WoC|title=The Making of American Liberal Theology: Imagining Progressive Religion, 1805–1900|date=January 1, 2001|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-22354-0|language=en|access-date=June 27, 2015|archive-date=September 6, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906030528/https://books.google.com/books?id=L50mveyi6WoC|url-status=live}}</ref>{{rp|1–4}} Following the death of [[Hollis Professor of Divinity]] [[David Tappan]] in 1803 and that of [[Joseph Willard]], Harvard's eleventh president, the following year, a struggle broke out over their replacements.

In 1816, Harvard University launched new language programs in the study of [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and appointed [[George Ticknor]] the university's first professor for these language programs.

From 1869 to 1909, [[Charles William Eliot]], Harvard University's 21st president, decreased the historically favored position of [[Christianity]] in the curriculum, opening it to student self-direction. Though Eliot was an influential figure in the secularization of U.S. higher education, he was motivated primarily by [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] convictions influenced by [[William Ellery Channing]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], and others, rather than secularism. In the late 19th century, Harvard University's graduate schools began admitting women in small numbers.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Stephen P.|last=Shoemaker|title=The Theological Roots of Charles W.

In 1900, Harvard became a founding member of the [[Association of American Universities]].<ref name="AAU" /> For the first few decades of the 20th century, the Harvard student body was predominantly "old-stock, high-status [[Protestantism|Protestants]], especially [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]], [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]], and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]]", according to sociologist and author [[Jerome Karabel]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Jerome Karabel|title=The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zwf-Ofc--toC&pg=PA23|year=2006|page=23|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |isbn=978-0-618-77355-8|access-date=November 5, 2015|archive-date=January 24, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124132732/https://books.google.com/books?id=zwf-Ofc--toC&pg=PA23|url-status=live}}</ref>

Over the 20th century, as its endowment burgeoned and prominent intellectuals and professors affiliated with it, Harvard University's reputation as one of the world's most prestigious universities grew notably. The university's enrollment also underwent substantial growth, a product of both the founding of new graduate academic programs and an expansion of the [[Harvard College|undergraduate college]]. [[Radcliffe College]] emerged as the female counterpart of Harvard College, becoming one of the most prominent schools in the nation for women.

In 1923, a year after the percentage of [[Jews|Jewish]] students at Harvard reached 20%, [[A. Lawrence Lowell]], the university's 22nd president, unsuccessfully proposed capping the admission of Jewish students to 15% of the undergraduate population. Lowell also refused to mandate forced desegregation in the university's [[List of Harvard College freshman dormitories|freshman dormitories]], writing that, "We owe to the colored man the same opportunities for education that we do to the white man, but we do not owe to him to force him and the white into social relations that are not, or may not be, mutually congenial."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2021/11/4/housing-desegregation/ |title=Compelled to coexist: A history of the desegregation of Harvard's freshman housing|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220928084627/https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2021/11/4/housing-desegregation/ |archive-date=September 28, 2022 |newspaper=Harvard Crimson|date=November 4, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Steinberg|first1=Stephen|title=How Jewish Quotas Began|journal=Commentary|date=September 1, 1971|url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/how-jewish-quotas-began/|access-date=September 10, 2017|archive-date=September 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911071351/https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/how-jewish-quotas-began/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Dirk|title=Yale's Limit on Jewish Enrollment Lasted Until Early 1960's Book Says|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/04/nyregion/yale-s-limit-on-jewish-enrollment-lasted-until-early-1960-s-book-says.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 4, 1986|access-date=December 3, 2017|archive-date=September 23, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210923074453/https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/04/nyregion/yale-s-limit-on-jewish-enrollment-lasted-until-early-1960-s-book-says.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Lowell Tells Jews Limits at Colleges Might Help Them|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/06/17/109843455.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 17, 1922|access-date=September 10, 2017|archive-date=March 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190323102413/https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/06/17/109843455.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Between 1933 and 1953, Harvard University was led by [[James B. Conant]], the university's 23rd president, who reinvigorated the university's creative scholarship in an effort to guarantee Harvard's preeminence among the nation and world's emerging research institutions. Conant viewed higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy, and devised programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth. In 1945, under Conant's leadership, an influential 268-page report, ''[[General Education in a Free Society]]'', was published by Harvard faculty, which remains one of the most important works in [[curriculum studies]],<ref>{{Cite book |editor-last1=Kridel |editor-first1=Craig |chapter=General Education in a Free Society (Harvard Redbook) |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GgMyFqxsXWoC&pg=PA400 400]–402 |title=Encyclopedia of Curriculum Studies |date=2010 |volume=1 |language=en |isbn=978-1-4129-5883-7 |publisher=SAGE  }}</ref> and women were first admitted to the [[Harvard Medical School|medical school]].<ref>{{cite report |title=First class of women admitted to Harvard Medical School, 1945 |publisher=Countway Repository, Harvard University Library |url=http://repository.countway.harvard.edu/xmlui/handle/10473/1782 |access-date=May 2, 2016 |date= |archive-date=June 23, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623235357/http://repository.countway.harvard.edu/xmlui/handle/10473/1782 }}</ref>

Harvard has the largest [[List of colleges and universities in the United States by endowment|university endowment]] in the world, valued at about $50.7&nbsp;billion as of 2023.<ref name=BGendow/><ref name=HFRendow/>

During the [[Great Recession|recession of 2007–2009]], it suffered significant losses that forced large budget cuts, in particular temporarily halting construction on the Allston Science Complex.<ref>{{cite news |author=Vidya B.

Harvard's ability to fund its degree and financial aid programs depends on the performance of its endowment; a poor performance in fiscal year 2016 forced a 4.4% cut in the number of graduate students funded by the [[Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences|Faculty of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/2/16/gsas-admissions-reaction/|title=Admissions Cuts Concern Some Graduate Students|access-date=December 14, 2019|archive-date=December 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225022732/http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/2/16/gsas-admissions-reaction/|url-status=live}}</ref>
